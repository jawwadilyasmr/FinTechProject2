Long short term memory, also know as LSTMs, are a unique type of RNN (recurrent neural network) that are capable of learning long term dependencies and are specifically designed to overcome the long term dependency problem. It is in their nature to remember information for long periods of time which is not possible with simple RNN models. The LSTM outputs the numbers between zero and one which describes how much component should be let through. The number zero means to **let nothing through** whereas, one means to **let everything through**. As we know that the LSTM is great at sequence prediction problems as they are able to store information from the past. This is essential as previous prices are important factor in predicting the future prices of stocks or indexes.
